# Will It Rain On My Parade?

This project is a web-based weather analysis application designed for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**. It allows users to plan outdoor activities by providing a personalized weather suitability score, analysis of extreme event probabilities, and long-term climate trends, all based on historical data from the NASA POWER API.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Custom Suitability Score (1-5):** Enter an activity, location, and date to get a clear score on how suitable the weather is. The system adjusts the importance of temperature, wind, and rain depending on your chosen activity.
* **Probability Analysis:** Find out the likelihood (%) of facing extreme conditions like heat, cold, rain, wind, or uncomfortable humidity, presented in an easy-to-understand chart.
* **Climate Trends Analysis:** Visualize how temperature and extreme weather events have evolved in a location over the last decade to understand local climate change.
* **Location Comparator:** Not sure where to go? Compare weather conditions for up to three different locations and get a recommendation on which is best for your activity.
* **Flexible Location Input:** Enter a location by typing its name or by selecting it directly on an interactive map.
* **Data Export:** Download your query results in **CSV** or **JSON** formats with a single click.
